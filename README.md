## AI Electronic Documentation Assistant

**Assisting Providers with Documentation and Medication Administration**

*The fundamental problem with AI is getting the data needed to make predictions, the overall complexity of the setup, and satisfaction of using machine learning as a healthcare provider. Providers should not need a computer science degree to implement AI in the hospital workflow. 
Doctors, Nurses, and pharmacist are leaving the field at alarming rates, due to increased charting demand, and increased patient
workload.As a former level 1 trauma nurse I can personally relate to the poor tech in healthcare causing increased provider stress, and decreased patient outcomes. If a provider does not document an action they could be sued, or even worse charged as a criminal. There is an old saying "if its not documented, its not done". The problem is its literally impossible for emergency providers to document all actions that occur in the field, especially in a 20 year old e-mar running IE 9. 



As a current full-stack software developer and RN  I hope to change that. working on applications to protect our healthcare providers.poor development and out dated technology is costing hospitals billions and providers  and make there job Easier,
