**The Problem**

*The fundamental problem with AI is getting the data needed to make predictions, the overall complexity of the setup, and satisfaction of using machine learning as a healthcare provider. Providers should not need a computer science degree to implement AI in the hospital workflow. 
Doctors, Nurses, and pharmacist are leaving the field at alarming rates, due to increased charting demand, and increased patient workload.As a former level 1 trauma nurse I can personally relate to the poor tech in healthcare causing increased provider stress, and decreased patient outcomes. If a provider does not document an action they could be sued, or even worse charged as a criminal. There is an old saying "if its not documented, its not done". The problem is its literally impossible for emergency providers to document all actions that occur in the field. 

**The Application**
* my goal was to create something that everyday users could deploy
As a current full-stack software developer and RN  I hope to change that. working on applications to protect our healthcare providers.poor development and out dated technology is costing hospitals billions and providers  and make there job Easier,
