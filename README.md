## AI Electronic Documentation Assistant

**Assisting Providers with Documentation and Medication Administration**

*The fundamental problem with AI is getting the data needed to make predictions, the overall complexity of the setup, and satisfaction of using machine learning as a healthcare provider. Providers should not need a computer science degree to implement AI in the hospital workflow. 
Doctors, Nurses, and pharmacist are leaving the field at alarming rates, due to increased charting demand, and increased patient
workload.As a former level 1 trauma nurse I can personally relate to the poor tech in healthcare causing increased provider stress, and decreased patient outcomes. If a provider does not document an action they could be sued, or even worse charged as a criminal. There is an old saying "if its not documented, its not done". The problem is its literally impossible for emergency providers to document all actions that occur in the field, especially in a 20 year old e-mar running IE 9. 



*As a current full-stack software developer and RN  I hope to change that. working on applications to protect our healthcare providers.poor development and out dated technology is costing hospitals billions and providers  and make there job Easier, *

**The Problem**

*The fundamental problem with AI is getting the data needed to make predictions, the overall complexity of the setup, and satisfaction of using machine learning as a healthcare provider. Providers should not need a computer science degree to implement AI in the hospital workflow.

The problem is its literally impossible for emergency providers to document all actions that occur in the field. 

**The Application**
* my goal was to create something that everyday users could deploy to generate more data, and allow everyday providers to implement AI. As a current full-stack software developer, and RN  I hope to change that by working on applications to protect our healthcare providers.Poor development and out dated technology is costing providers there license, and hospitals billions. The idea is simple allow providers to create there own modals to document actions. This Serves 3 purposes.
1. *To Allow Providers to get back to the patient and save nurses and doctors from lawsuits due to missing documentation*
2. *Hospitals will save tremendous amounts of money, from lawsuits, and actions that were not documented*
3. *The patient will feel like the provider is listening instead of stairing into a computer*



**how to run program**
*Google Chrome
*Requirements - Must have NPM installed
* To check if you do, open your Bash commandline and type npm --v  (if it returns a number such as 6.9 NPM is installed, if command not found you will need to install NPM. (google installing NPM)


**Install**
1. Click Download file 
2. Extract File to your computer 
3. Once inside of the root directory Run *NPM install*
4. Once Installed run *Npm build*
5. Once Built run google-chrome "index.html" or double click html file or npm start 



**How to Use**
**At the bottom you will see a text to speech option that will allow you to type messages to patients in any language**
 **You will see 3 trainable modals with a preselected actions  providers will be able to choose these actions in future versions**
 
 **make a unique shape with your hand in front of the camera  and train for at least 20 Images, When training YOU HAVE TO HOLD BUTTON DOWN and then release after modals are captured**
 
 **For Each Image A sound will play on training and then when all three are trained, doing the same hand signal it was trained with it will trigger that action, providers could use this make there own documentation signals. This will send a function to the Electornic medical record to document  interactions and medication administrations**
 
 **The modals also server a secondary purpose of collecting data, after thousands of modals providers could automate most of if not all required actions Being a win win for the entire healthcare system**
 
 
 **If Sound does not work, or after training buttons do not click, simpley restart the broswer, BETA test app built in 20 hours by single developer. Will be building future versions soon**
 
 
 
 **for issues please send message to me, beta app **
